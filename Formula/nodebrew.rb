  def caveats; <<~EOS
    You need to manually run setup_dirs to create directories required by nodebrew:
      #{opt_bin}/nodebrew setup_dirs

    Add path:
      export PATH=$HOME/.nodebrew/current/bin:$PATH

    To use Homebrew's directories rather than ~/.nodebrew add to your profile:
      export NODEBREW_ROOT=#{var}/nodebrew
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match /v0.10.0/, shell_output("#{bin}/nodebrew ls-remote")
  end
end
